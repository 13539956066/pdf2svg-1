  this file contains a mapping from character name to UNICODE codepoint
  for a particular font

  when people discover a weird font that have been used in a pdf file
  they create a mapping file such as this for it

  the process then is to eyeball each character in the font and decide
  which UNICODE character (of the hundreds of thousands that exist)
  bests represents the character in the font
